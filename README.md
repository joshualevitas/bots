First we roll a 10 sided die to choose how many links our creature will have. We generate the torso, and then to creatre
the rest of the body of the creature, we roll a 3 sided die to choose which direction the next link will face (stemming from the previously added link).

Every joint has a motor in my creatures, and the sensor network is fully connected. I'm not entirely sure this is optimal, but I don't quite care about running time at the moment, since the creatures are still fairly small.
